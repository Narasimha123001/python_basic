“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Cognizant’s job simulation on the Forage platform,
and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate
in a Data Science team, to work with Python and Google Colab in a realistic
context and to produce, evaluate and improve a production machine learning
model. 
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy researching and improving
the performance of machine learning models and would love to apply what I've
learned in Cognizant’s Data Science team.
